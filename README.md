# 15-150 M21 Bad Style Competition

August 2021


## Prompt
This year's task was to implement `rev : 'a list -> 'a list` which reverses lists of any type. Work and span bounds of O(the code tester's patience). Other bindings can be made in addition to `rev`, and there are no restrictions on what effects `rev` may have, so long as they do not affect `rev`'s correctness.
